          <h4>Ingredients</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Red or white grape juice - 2l</li>
            <li>Fresh walnuts or hazelnuts - 400g</li>
            <li>Flour(courn or wheat)- 260g</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          Prepare a string of fresh walnut halves or whole hazelnuts that you
          thread on a thick cotton thread of 15 to 20cm, using a suitable needle
          and make a knot at one end and a loop at the other end (so that it can
          be hung up to dry). Prepare the pelamushi, i.e. your thickened grape
          syrup. To do this, pour half of your juice into a saucepan and boil
          for 15 minutes. In the other half of your grape juice, pour your flour
          gradually, mixing little by little to avoid the formation of lumps.
          Add this mixture to the boiling juice. Continue to cook until the
          volume of the mixture decreases by a quarter. Then dip your rosaries
          in turn into the pelamushi, three times in a row, pausing for 30s each
          time. Hang them to dry for 30 minutes. Repeat the operation several
          times in a row, if necessary, until the beads are covered with a layer
          of this jelly 1 to 1.5 cm thick. These churchkhela will then be hung
          to dry for two weeks in a dark place. The juice will harden on the
          outside while the inside will remain softer. You can taste it
          afterwards or keep it for several more months by wrapping it in a
          towel in a dark, dry place.
