          For traditional Armenian khorovats, the best choice would be a pork
          loin, ribs and tenderloin. Most of all the locals love meat on the
          bone, it is believed here that such kind of meat is the tastiest.
          After buying the meat, it is necessary to cut it into pieces and
          marinate. One of the characteristic features of Armenian khorovats is
          that meat is cut into large chunks. The loin should be cut along into
          medium pieces with the thickness of 2-3 cm. When all the pieces are
          ready, it’s time to start marinating. For that, you will need white
          onions, black pepper and dried basil. Meat should not be salted.
          Pepper the meat on all sides and sprinkle with dried basil, rubbing
          and crushing it in hands. Then cut the onion into thin half-ringsTake
          a broad deep bowl and place the bottom with the first layer of the
          onion. Then lay the second layer with some pieces of meat. The next
          layer – the onion again. Put the bowl into the refrigerator for one
          day. After the necessary time is over it’s time to pass to the next
          stage – the skewering and roasting the meat. We recommend getting the
          meat out of the refrigerator in advance so that it acquires room
          temperature. After you have skewered the meat it is time to salt it
          using coarse salt. Well, that’s all, now you can proceed directly to
          roasting of the Armenian khorovats. Once the coals are covered with
          white ash, you can begin to roast the meat. Based on the ancient
          Armenian traditions, the more you’ll turn the skewers, the tastier
          khorovats will be. Khorovats is served on the traditional Armenian
          bread lavash with onion. Well, that’s all – bon appetit!
